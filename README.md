# Deep Learning Project Template
This template offers a lightweight yet functional project template for various deep learning projects. 
The template assumes [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the deep learning framework.
However, one can easily transfer and utilize the template to any project implemented with other frameworks.

## Getting Started
You can fork this repo and use it as a template when creating a new repo on Github like this:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/xduan7/dl-project-template/blob/master/docs/readme/create_a_new_repo.png" width="90%">
</p>
Or directly use the template from the forked template repo like this:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/xduan7/dl-project-template/blob/master/docs/readme/use_template.png" width="90%">
</p>

Alternatively, you can simply download this repo in zipped format and get started:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/xduan7/dl-project-template/blob/master/docs/readme/download.png" width="90%">
</p>

Next, you can install all the dependencies by typing the following command in project root:
```bash
conda careate -n project_name python=3.8
conda install poetry  # or 'pip install poetry'
poetry new project_name
```

Finally, you can wrap up the setup by manually install and update any packages you'd like. 
Please refer to the [Extra Packages](#extra-packages) section for some awesome packages.
