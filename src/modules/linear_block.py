        This function constructs a linear (dense/fully-connected) neural

        activation function (type and options), batch-normalization,
        and dropout rate are all specified in the arguments.
        The constructed block is made up with multiple layers of [linear,
        batch-normalization*, activation, dropout*] where * means optional.
        Note that the function throws warnings for unrecommended
        configurations but will proceed nevertheless.

        layers. For example, [32, 16, 8] indicates two linear layers,
